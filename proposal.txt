Project 1 Proposal 

We will be looking at historical data for earthquakes and air quality using APIs from https://aqs.epa.gov/
aqsweb/documents/about_aqs_data.html#_time. We hypothesize that there will be a "negative" impact on 
air quality immediately following an earthquake, i.e. an increase in SO2 and NOx. To scale our project, we 
will only be using an air quality API and using the time stamp of 2 large earthquakes that we've selected 
from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/browse/. In order to analyze our data, we need to know the 
Epicenter/Location, Magnitude, and Time Stamp and run against the air quality, specifically SO2 and NOx 
(possibly other gases if we see any other trends), in the location before, during, and after the earthquake. 
We will use a geojson to create a box (latitude and longtidue) around the epicenter. 

Using matplotlib, and written in jupyter notebook, we will visualize our data using line graphs, scatter plots. 
As a bonus we will try to create a geolocation "heat map" that shows air quality post-earthquake.
