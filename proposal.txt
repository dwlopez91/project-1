Project 1 Proposal 

We will be looking at historical data for earthquakes and air quality using APIs from blank and blank. 
We hypothesize that there will be a negative impact on air quality immediately following an earthquake. 
To scale our project, we will only be using an air quality API and using the time stamp of large earthq-
uakes (determiend 6+) that we've selected from https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/browse/. In order 
to analyze our data, we need to know the Epicenter/Location, Magnitude, and Time Stamp and run against 
the air quality  in the loacation before, during, and after the earthquake.  

Parameters to look into from the EPA: our plan is to run a report on a 3-4 earthquakes and pick out the 
most dramatic changes that we see and base any anlysis after that on those parameters.
